This code demonstrates pass-by-reference.  Javascript uses pass-by-reference when you pass object values or variables assigned to object values to a function as arguments or return an object from a function.


The array method concat() creates a shallow copy of the array it is being called on and then adds any values or objects passed to it as an argument. It then returns that new array.  The concat() method is non-destructive and does not mutate the calling array.

The array method slice() extracts a shallow copied portion of the array that it is called on and returns that as a new array.  A starting index and ending(non-inclusive) index can be passed as arguements.  If no arguements are passed to the method, then it makes a copy of the entire array.  The slice() method is non-destructive and does not mutate the calling array.
