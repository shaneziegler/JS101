The variable `pets` is initialized and assigned to an array `[ 'dragon', 'turtle' ]`.  The variable `newPets` is initialized and assigned to point to the variable `pets`.  On line 40, pets is reassigned to an empty array.  `newPets` is logged to the console, which outputs `[ 'dragon', 'turtle' ]`.  The concept shown here is variables as pointers.  Even when `pets` is set to an empty array, newPets still points to the original `pets` array object in memory.

The variable `something` is initialized and assigned to an empty array `[]`. The variable `somethingElse` is initialized and assigned to an empty string value ``.  `Radio` is logged to the console on line 7, because both '""' and `[]` coerce to to the boolean value `false`, and are considered equal when using the loose equality comparison operator.  The concept show here is strict vs loose equality.  The code does not log `TV`, because the strict equality operator on line 4, require both the value and data types to the same.
